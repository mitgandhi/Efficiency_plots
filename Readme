This repository contains a raw data file ``V32HL56-efficiency test.txt``
with pump efficiency measurements.  The script ``plot_efficiencies.py``
reads the data, sorts it by speed, displacement and pressure and
produces line plots for hydromechanical, volumetric and overall
efficiencies versus speed.

Usage:

```
python plot_efficiencies.py
```

Generated plots are stored in the ``plots`` directory.
