This repository contains a raw data file ``V32HL56-efficiency test.txt``
with pump efficiency measurements.  Use ``txt_to_csv.py`` to convert
the text file to ``V32HL56-efficiency.csv``.  The script
``plot_efficiencies.py`` reads the CSV data, sorts it by speed,
displacement and pressure and produces line plots for hydromechanical,
volumetric and overall efficiencies versus speed.

Usage:

Convert the text data to CSV::

    python txt_to_csv.py

Then generate the efficiency plots::

    python plot_efficiencies.py

Generated plots are stored in the ``plots`` directory.
